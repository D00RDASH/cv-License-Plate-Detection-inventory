# [AI License Plate Detection]
![Demo Screenshot or GIF](results/demo.gif)
*My project contains a model that analyzes license plate images and uses object detection to capture them in bounding boxes.*

## Problem & Solution
### The Problem

Law enforcement officers spend hours manually reviewing footage to identify vehicles linked to crimes or terror-related activities.
Having faster and more reliable license-plate detection allows authorities to prevent attacks, locate suspects quickly, and strengthen public safety.

### Our Solution

My solution is to develop an AI-based license-plate detection system capable of identifying and localizing plates from images and videos.
The model is shown a bunch of license plate images. The YOLO model is supposed analyzes them and it detects the license plates using object detection.
