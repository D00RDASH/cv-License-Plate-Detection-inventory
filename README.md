# [AI License Plate Detection]
![Demo Screenshot or GIF](results/demo.gif)
*My project contains a model that analyzes license plate images and uses object detection to capture them in bounding boxes.*

## Project Tier
**Tier [1]** - [Why this tier? What makes it this level?]--

Tier 1: CORE PROJECT (100 points possible)
For: Everyone, especially beginners
Difficulty: ⭐⭐☆☆☆
Time: Achievable in 5-6 weeks
Resources: Free tier (Colab/Kaggle)
Description: Simple CV project using pre-trained model

I chose this tier because since I was working independently I would want to do something easy. License Plate Detection is tier 1 because I can program with Google Collab and get my dataset from Kaggle which is exactly what I did. It's also tier 1 because I'm working with Yolo V8 which is a pre-trained model.

## Problem & Solution
### The Problem

Law enforcement officers spend hours manually reviewing footage to identify vehicles linked to crimes or terror-related activities.
Having faster and more reliable license-plate detection allows authorities to prevent attacks, locate suspects quickly, and strengthen public safety.

### Our Solution

My solution is to develop an AI-based license-plate detection system capable of identifying and localizing plates from images and videos.
The model is shown a bunch of license plate images. The YOLO model is supposed analyzes them and it detects the license plates using object detection.

### Impact
[Who benefits? How much time/money saved? What's the value?]--

#### Who benefits?

Law Enforcement Agencies

Public Safety and Security Agencies

Emergency Responders

Public Heath and Safety Sectors

Policy Makers and Planners

Communities and Schools

#### How much time/money saved?
#### What's the value?
It provides a key vulnerability to exploit, as nearly all terrorist operations involve vehicles for surveillance, transporting weapons, approaching targets, and escape attempts.
